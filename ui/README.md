This app support index DB as based on [dexie library](https://dexie.org/). In order to initiatiate index db then you have to passed index db configuration in forRoot of core module, so in app.module.ts

```ts
........
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, ...fromPages.pages],
  imports: [
   ..........
    CoreModule.forRoot({
      namespace: 'iapps',
      version: 1,
      models: {
        users: 'id',
        dataElement: 'id',
        .......
